## Project: Recipes
This is my first project in the *TOP curriculum*, created for the purpose of practicing **HTML**.
It is created for purpose of practicing **HTML**. 

Initially, it will be a simple website created solely using **HTML** tags. 
Later on, I plan to revisit this project and add some **CSS** styling to enhance its visual appeal.

**Website will consist of:**
* an index page 
* links to other pages containing recipes

Completing this project will demonstrate my proficiency in using basic **HTML**.
