## Project: Recipes
This is my first project in the *TOP curriculum*, created for the purpose of practicing **HTML**.
It is created for purpose of practicing **HTML**. 

Initially, it will be a simple website created solely using **HTML** tags. 
Later on, I plan to revisit this project and add some **CSS** styling to enhance its visual appeal.

**Website will consist of:**
* an index page 
* links to other pages containing recipes

Completing this project will demonstrate my proficiency in using basic **HTML**.

# Adding CSS to Project

After revisiting the recipe site project, I have made significant improvements by adding more content and applying styling using CSS.

## What's New:

I have introduced several key features and sections:

- **Header:** Designed a header with a logo and navigation links.
- **Hero Banner:** Added an eye-catching hero banner.
- **Recipe Section:** Included a section dedicated to displaying recipes.
- **Articles Section:** Created a separate area for food-related articles.
- **Footer:** Designed a footer to wrap up the website.

## Purpose:

The goal of this project was to transform a basic HTML-only website into a more visually appealing and user-friendly platform. I aimed to create a simple, yet attractive website that caters to food enthusiasts who want to share their passion for food.
